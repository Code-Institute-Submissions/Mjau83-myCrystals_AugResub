### A handy way to organize your crystals


![Responsive Image](assets/images/responsive-image.png)


## Project Goals
**What is it?** 
A simple way to store information about your crystals so that you can access the information when you need it.

**Who is it for?**
This is for any healer, witch, yogi or anyone that likes spriritual stuff and might use crystals in their daily life, 
in rituals, meditaion or other practices. 

**Why am I building it?**
Almost everytime when I'm going to use a crystal for a specific purpose I need to check my crystal box to see what 
I have, and if I can't remember what it's used for I also need to turn to Google to find out the specific properties.
After asking around in different spriritually themed communities it turned out that I wasn't alone. I hope that this 
site can help us get a little bit more organized.

## Bugs

**Opacity bug**
* **Bug**

The opacity of the background image in index.html and register.html affects
all the content on the page so that the card and form also gets more transparent.

* **Fix**

At first I had just added opacity to the #crystal-background in style.css.
I then tried adding a div with the class of "opaque-overlay" after the "crystal-background" div, 
and then giving it a z-index of -1 and the crystal-background a z-index of -2.
I then gave opaque-overlay background-color of #ffffff and a opacity of 0.5
That didn't solve the problem.
After some reading on W3 Schools I change hex to rgba, and got it to work.

* **Verdict**

The background image is showing with a white opaque overlay without affecting the rest of the
content on the page.
